# Test Team Handbook

Welcome to the Test Team Handbook! In these pages you can learn how and where to get involved in testing WordPress. If you want to help improve WordPress quality and usability, and advance the development process, then you've come to the right place!

## Duty of Care
While the Test Team originally stemmed from the [Core Team](https://make.wordpress.org/core/), contributions to WordPress testing have grown to encompass the entire WordPress ecosystem. Of course the efforts of Test Team contributors benefit WordPress and the [core editor](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/), but also sub-projects like [Design](https://make.wordpress.org/design/) and [Themes](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/), [Accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/), [mobile apps](https://wordpress.org/mobile/), [WP-CLI](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/), [Feature Projects](https://make.wordpress.org/core/features/), [importers](https://github.com/WordPress?q=importers), and even [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org) itself.

Test Team contributions touch on all aspects of manual and automated testing within the project, including:

- [WordPress release beta testing](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta-testing/) and [editor pre-release testing](https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/gutenberg-testing/regression-testing/)
- [full site editing (FSE) outreach](https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/full-site-editing-outreach-experiment/)
- [issue reproduction](https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/test-reports/#2-issue-reproduction) and [patch testing](https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/test-reports/#3-patch-testing)
- feature and enhancement testing
- PHP and JavaScript unit testing
- end-to-end (E2E) testing
- [issue triage and bug scrubs](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/bug-gardening/)
- education, outreach, and documentation

With such a wide range of opportunities available, contributors are sure to find an area of interest to help make WordPress better.

## Contributors Welcome
Contributors to testing have a wide variety of experience and technical knowledge, from beginners with little WordPress experience to seasoned developers who have contributed for years.

Just as WordPress is open to anyone and everyone, numerous opportunities exist for Test Team contributions regardless of individual skill level. And, like the larger WordPress community, contributors in the Test Team are enthusiastic to share their knowledge and expertise.

## Where to Find the Test Team
In addition to posts and discussions in the [Test Team blog](https://make.wordpress.org/test/), the team [meets regularly](https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/#test) on the [Make WordPress Slack #core-test channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-test/). Stop on by, and let's talk about testing!
