## Welcome!
First of all, welcome to the Test release squad! üéâ It's so awesome you've stepped forward to help spread feature awareness and to support testing efforts for the release!

If you haven‚Äôt already, please take some time to read through the release process, team roles, and expectations:

- Release Cycle: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/
	- Major Versions: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/releasing-major-versions/
- Release Team: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/wordpress-release-team-and-focus-leads/¬†-- some key sections:
	- Shared Responsibilities: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/wordpress-release-team-and-focus-leads/#shared-responsibilities
	- Test Responsibilities: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/wordpress-release-team-and-focus-leads/#test

Additionally, now is a good time to bookmark key Make WordPress resources, which grow and evolve as the release unfolds. Look for this release's "Development Cycle", "Planning", and "Roadmap" posts for a good start. Here are some examples from 6.3:

Be on the lookout for posts about the release, features, etc -- consume as much as you can.
